###Notes on the data set
I added two columns in the original datasets, on for the activity type and one for the subject. 
Then I joined the two main datasets (train and test) into one.
Then I selected only those columns which contained the strings "mean()" and "std()". There was a choice made here:
there were also columns containing "mean" in a different position, like "fBodyAccMag-meanFreq()". Since we
were asked to "Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement"
and since the standard deviation measurements were of the form "std()" I decided to choose only those
measurements on the mean whose description was of similar form.
I also noticed that some variables had by mistake included twice the word "Body"; I left only one instance of this
word in them.
The values in the data set correspond to the *average* of each variable from the original data set for each 
activity and each subject.
